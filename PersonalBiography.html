                    <p> This is one of the most common steps that people struggle with when learning how to write a bio. While
                        it can feel strange to talk about yourself in the third person at first, there are some very clear
                        benefits from doing so:</p>
                    </br>

                    <p>From an SEO perspective, writing a bio in the third person allows you to include your full name throughout
                        the bio. This lets search engines know that this lengthy, original, and well-written piece of content
                        is about you. While making it clear that this awesome work is about you is important when it comes
                        to search engine optimization, don’t let speaking in third person become too much of a good thing.</p>
                    </br>

                    <p>Never overuse your name when writing a bio or include it in a way that seems unnatural. Instead, use
                        your name when it is appropriate. By dropping your name too frequently, search engines may think
                        that the article looks suspicious/spammy – or isn’t written very well.</p>
                    </br>

                    <p>
                        Speaking in the third person suggests that someone else is speaking about you. And since it’s likely that others will use
                        your various bios as a resource to describe you, writing in the third person makes it easier for
                        others to talk about you using information straight from your personal bio.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Whether you have an upcoming speaking engagement that requires a bio blurb, or a colleague introduces you via email to someone
                        you’ve wanted to work with for years, your third-person bio makes it easy for others to share information
                        about you with people who you want in your corner.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        When practicing how to write a bio about yourself effectively, you can’t spend enough time focusing on this. Writing in the
                        third person makes information about you shareable and accessible. From a branding perspective, this
                        alone is reason enough to write in the third person! If you want to learn more about how this all
                        works, check out our online reputation management guide too.
